"Studies reveal that an average individual in business reads no faster than "
"what people did nearly 10 decades back. As such, the average reading speed "
"also varies based on an individual’s profession. On a broader spectrum, an "
"adult reads about 300 words per minute on an average. On the other hand, a "
"college student reads about 450 words per minute on an average. The increase "
"in speed is primarily because a student is exposed to more reading "
"activities in comparison to an adult. The increased practice definitely "
"offers an upper edge over here, when it comes to speed reading. It’s "
"estimated that a student spends nearly 4-5 hours a day for reading or "
"studying activities."
